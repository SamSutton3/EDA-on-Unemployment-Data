# EDA-on-Unemployment-Data

The data that has been collected here was given to me from an AfterSkills training on Machine Learning.

This data has then been used to develop my own understanding in the use of personal projects.

The data used details different Countries and Unemployment Rates, these datasets are merged together and EDA is used on them to evaluate them.
