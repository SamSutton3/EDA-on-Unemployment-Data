# EDA-on-Unemployment-Data

## Introduction

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that focuses on analyzing and visualising Unemployment Data from various countries.

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the trends of unemployment, and provide meaningful visualisations to track unemployment across different countries and time periods.

## Data
The data that has been collected here was given to me from an AfterSkills training on Machine Learning.

This data has then been used to develop my own understanding in the use of personal projects.

The data used contains two different ".csv" files for Country and Unemployment data respectively.
